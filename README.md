🌊 Smart Harbour Management System

The Smart Harbour Management System (SHMS) is a modern, technology-driven platform designed to digitize and optimize port and harbour operations. It provides real-time visibility, automation, and decision-support tools for port authorities, operators, logistics companies, and customs.

🚢 Why this project?

Traditional harbour operations often face challenges like delays in vessel berthing, inefficient cargo handling, limited visibility on vessel movements, and inadequate safety/environmental monitoring.
SHMS solves these by bringing all key operations under a single, smart, and secure system.

✨ Key Features

Real-Time Vessel Tracking (AIS/GPS integration)

Berth & Resource Management (automated berth assignment, congestion alerts)

Cargo & Manifest Handling (upload, track, verify shipments)

Security & Surveillance (gate logs, CCTV integration, incident reports)

Environmental Monitoring (air & water quality, oil spill detection, alerts)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Admin, Operator, Customs, Pilot, Viewer)

Reporting & Analytics (KPIs, compliance, exportable reports)

Notifications & Alerts (SMS/Email/Push for vessel delays or safety events)

🏗️ Tech Stack (suggested)

Frontend: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox/Leaflet

Backend: Spring Boot (Java) / Node.js (TypeScript)

Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (for geospatial data)

Messaging: Kafka / RabbitMQ (for sensor & vessel streams)

Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes, CI/CD via GitHub Actions

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
